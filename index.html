            <p class="breathing-space"> 
                Our half-hectare vineyard has been planted by our family members back in 2002 on a hill constituting the watershed 
                of the Dunajec and Biała Tarnowska rivers. 
                The immediate vicinity of the Polish pole of heat creates excellent 
                climatic conditions for viticulture.
            </p>

                Since we were one of the first winemakers in the entire area, 
                the vineyard aroused great interest in local television, press and people from the very beginning .
                Our passion has rapidly spread around the area, inspiring other people to reviving the 
                old wine-making tradition and funding a large number of new vineyards 
                in Lesser Poland Voivodeship. 
                To this day, this trend continues, which gives us the conviction that our hard work is worth continuing.

                We make our best effort to use ecological plant protection products in the cultivation process of the vineyard.
                We grow wine grape varieties used for the production of white wine (Solaris, Johanniter, Muscaris and some of 
                old Aurora variety) as well as varieties for rosé and red wine (Regent, Monarch, Bolero, Illiczewskij and Sevar).
                We also grow a small range of dessert grapes. In addition to winemaking, we also make traditional Polish mead 
                "Trójniak" (eng. "Three Parts").

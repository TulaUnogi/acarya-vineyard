 #### Typography:

    - Poiret One and Great Vibes have been chosen as the headings fonts as they've been used in the logo and they provide elegant, aesthetically pleasing experience for a user.
    - Montserrat has been used as a main body elements. It's a popular and commonly used font in programming. Thanks to it's clean and simple design it compliments the decorative aspects of the headings.
    - Sans Serif and Helvetica are used as a fallback fonts in case of the main fonts not being imported into the site.
       
#### Imagery:

    - Imagery is crucial, as it gives the first impression of what ACARYA's website is about. The hero image represents clusters of freshly picked white grapes, which corresponds with the main line of the business. The warm colours of the picture are in perfect harmony with the website's colour scheme.
